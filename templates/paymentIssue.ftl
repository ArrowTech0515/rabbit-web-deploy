Hello ${user.firstName},
<br /><br />
We are truly sorry about that, but there was an issue with your payment of $${payment.amount} at ${paymentDate}.
<br />
<br />
You were charged only $${payedAmount} instead of $${payment.amount} (you can check that in your bank records).
<br />
The issue was that the charge was in NIS currency instead of USD currency, therefor the charge was much lower than it should be (1USD = ${usdToNis}NIS}.
<br />
<br />
So now we are issuing a charge for the rest of the amount, which is $${newAmount}.
<br />
We apologize for the mistake, and we would be happy to compensate you with 2 free blog posts.
<br />
<br />
Thanks and sorry again,
<br />
