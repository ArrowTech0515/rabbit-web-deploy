                            </div>
                            <p>SEO Stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is all about optimizing a website for search engines and some would say it is the art of ranking in the search engines. It is basically the process of designing and developing a web site to rank well in search engine results. You can think of it as the technical part of online marketing since helps to promote your website but… it also needs some technical knowledge and skills. Anyway, don’t you worry because it’s not rocket science :)</p>

                            <p>So we are referring to the collection of techniques that allow our website to get more traffic from search engines (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft etc).<br> <br> <span>SEO can be divided into two main areas: off-page SEO – this is the work we do externally from our website and on-page SEO – these are the changes we make on our website.</span>
                                <br><br>
                             <span>And just to make sure we are all on the same page … when we say SEO we don’t mean purchasing the number #1 sponsored link through Google Adwords. Purchasing sponsored links is more in the area of PPC (Pay Per Click). SEO is also not ranking #1 for our company's name - search engines are usually smart enough to give you the first rank for your company name by default (it might take some time to scan your website though).</span>

                            <p>We are using SEO to improve the volume and quality of traffic to our website from search engines. SEO is a very important technique for any website willing to get more traffic.
                                <br> <br>
                                <span>With everyone using the internet to obtain information, SEO became a very important part in the last years to attract visitors to our website through search engines. Ideally, with SEO we want our website to appear higher in search engines results for certain keywords (that are related to the topic of your website) which will result in a higher volume and quality of visitors.</span>
                                <br> <br>
                                <span>If we want to do SEO right, there are many factors to think about. It is import to understand how search engines work and how they look at our website. Then we need to change our website for the keywords we want to rank well by changing the content and titles.

                            </div>
                            <p>It is important to remember that search engines are not humans but text-driven computers. Search engines do not care about how our website looks but more on the content it has. The main processes of search engines are crawling, indexing, and retrieving process.
                                <br><br>
                                <b> <span>Crawling</span> -</b> <span>the websites are crawled by the search engine crawlers (Google bot in the case of Google). This means the crawler will look at the text on a website and looks for links to different pages from that website.</span><br>
                                <b> <span>Indexing</span> – </b><span>creating index for all the fetched web pages and keeping them in a database from where it can later be fetched. Essentially, the process of indexing is identifying the words and expressions that best describe the page and assigning the page to particular keywords. This is also why it is important we decide which keywords we want to promote and optimize our website for.</span><br>
                                <b><span> Retrieving Process</span> -</b> <span>when a search engine user looks for keywords their search strings will be matched to the index database and the search engine will return a list of best-matching pages (websites). We can have million or even billion of pages will be matched to the search string and that is why the search engine calculates which pages are the most relevant for our search.</span></p>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Before we can start optimizing our website for the search engines, we first need to know which keywords (terms) we want to target. We might want to choose 3 or 4 keywords we would like our website to rank well for. We usually refer to Google as the search engine because if you can rank well there, you'll probably rank well on the other search engines too. These keywords can be either broad or specific, but you'll want to study them before, mostly the local search volume and the competition. This research can be done with Google Keywords Tool. You can enter a term that relates to your website, e.g. flowers delivery and then see other related keywords. Obviously, we want to take those with lower competitions but with a nice amount of local searches as those can be the “quick wins”. You can monitor your keywords in the Rankings tab!
                                <br><br>
                                <span>Choosing the right keywords is very important also for the next steps as “Content is the King”. Content is probably the biggest driving force to high ranking. It is extremely important to have a descent amount of quality content containing our keywords and relevant text for our keywords. Trust the search engines that they will know if you just “plant” your keywords in a text which is not related to it. It’s obvious that users love fresh content, but search engines do as well. Generally, when a website is frequently updated, this increases the probability that the search engines will revisit the site sooner.</span>

                                Linking is a very important part of our SEO. This is part of the off-page SEO. Websites need to be linked to if they want to be found on the internet and gain traffic. When a website is newly created it can take some time to be indexed in the search engines. Having links to from other websites makes this process much faster but of course it has to be balanced and not too many links and too fast. Search engines think the more websites linking to your webpage, the more important your webpage will be. It is also very important to get quality backlinks as it improves the importance of your website. There are 3 types of links:<br>
                                <b><span>Inbound links</span> -</b> <span>When an external website links to our page.</span><br>
                                <b> <span>Outbound links</span> -</b> <span>When linking from our website to another page.</span><br>
                                <b><span>Internal links</span> -</b><span>When linking within our website to all the pages.</span><br>
                                <br><br>
                                <span>Web site Crawler will go to a site again and again whose ranking in Search Engine is high. You can verify this fact by putting your site on a high rank site. If your site link is available on a high rank web site then you have 99.99% chances that you site will be indexed with-in 24Hrs.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <span>What can we do to improve?</span> <br>
                                <span>Submit your site in popular search engines manually. Don't go for automated submission.</span>
                                <br>
                                <span>Provide high quality content - people will naturally link to your site if you have what they want and couldn’t find it elsewhere.</span>
                                <br>
                                <span>If you have personal relations with other webmasters, try to leverage it. Put your site link on their sites. One way links often count for more than reciprocal links.</span>
                                <br>
                                <span>Try to find Link Exchange Program. Find websites that are doing the same business and contact them for links exchange.</span>

                               A landing page, sometimes called a destination page, is the web page that visitors arrive at after they click the link on a search engine results page. A landing page can be the first page of a website that was advertised on the search engine results page, or from one of the natural results from the search query. This page generally displays logical information, usually something that pertains directly to the keywords searched, or has the keywords directly on the page.
                                <br><br>
                                <span>It is very important to optimize your landing pages for 2 reasons: first, optimized landing page are likely to get higher ranking by the search engines. Second, attractive landing pages are likely to lead to conversion by your potential customers. These conversion may differ from one website to another – you probably know what means a “success” in your website. It can be someone that left his details in the contact us form, someone who bought a product, someone who left a comment to your article etc.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <span>By creating specific pages for different marketing channels, you’ll be able to customize your marketing message, which will provide revenue lifts. There are plenty of tutorials out there how to optimize and design landing pages so go ahead and try them.</span>

                                <span>As we stated before, back links are very important to generate traffic. If we address our competitors and suggest some sort of links exchange, we can get a high quality back link to our website. It is high quality because our competitor is in the same field as we do so the search engine see that as a relevant link.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <span>It is also important to see where are our competitors ranked for the same keywords we are promoting and also to see maybe other keywords they are promoting and we haven’t thought about.</span>

We might find the right keywords that describe our web page, but the users use other keywords (for instance, we decided to promote the keyword ‘flowers shop’ but users would search for ‘flowers delivery’. We must think like the user does, and see what keywords are used more than others.</span>

                                <b><span>Lack of keywords in the content</span> – </b>
                                <span>Once we found the keywords we want to promote, we have to make sure we embed them in the content of our website, especially in the title of the pages. We could write articles and have these keywords in them for instance.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                <b><span>Irrelevant backlinks</span> –</b> 
                                <span>it is very important to have other websites linking to our website but we have to make sure we get high quality links. For example, if we have a flowers delivery shop and we get a link from cars website it is not as ideal as to get a link from a gifts website (as flowers are somehow related to gifts).</span>

                                <b> <span>Spamming our keywords</span> –</b>
                                <span>of course we need to embed the keywords we want to promote in our website, but we have to do it in a fashionly way and not to spam our website with that keyword too much.</span>
