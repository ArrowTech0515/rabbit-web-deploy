I had just spent circa 40 years in IT from lowly computer operator to senior consultant and all points in between. My first experience of website design was using some seriously old editing technology (GraphicCorp's website design tool - now well and truly redundant) I used this to document our Gap Year down under and then when we travelled from one side of Canada to the other. Once this died, I signed up with Moonfruit (the then leading independent website design and development tool provider). This coincided with my wife starting her small craft business and her winning Theo Paphitis's Small Business Sunday (SBS) so my first website design and development with this new technology was her Girls Designer Clothes biz site. Having cut my teeth on that I redeveloped the Gap Year & Canada sites. My skillset in website design and development was increasing. In 2012 having finally bought our own motorhome I created the 1st edition of our motorhome-travels blog to give hints and tips for other homers and document our travels. I then created 2 further sites taking much of the learning I had already got in website design into the sites of our long holidays (mostly in hired motorhomes) in 2013 & 2017. So far, I have written 12 sites since retiring plus in all humility I do have some understanding of the BIG PICTURE with respect to (wrt) IT and computing after a lifetime in the industry. In December 2021 Yell who owned Moonfruit decided to close it down (it was past its prime as heavily wedded to the antiquated flash technology) and they much against my wishes migrated (badly) all my sites to WIX (a much better development environment) so I am now slowly but surely redoing all 12 sites (mostly from scratch) anyhow now that I am fully retired (I did go back to do some more consultancy work after my initial retirement for probably about a year on and off) and have a passion to help smaller businesses by providing a service that hopefully is somewhat scaled down from the charges (and subscription fees for ongoing maintenance that the big players charge) If I am selected as your website designer online, I would also carefully look at your Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), which is a subject I am starting to understand in greater detail. Good website design must show examples and be readily found online. There is a whole page devoted to that on this website and via the BLOGS. I feature on many lists of \\\"hire a website designer UK\\\", but my focus is mostly in the East Midlands, namely Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire. KeefH Web Designs is a trusted website design company, and I am proud of my WIX partner awards. So, if you are a small startup or family business and need an online presence or would just like to refresh your existing e-commerce site why not head over to look at my EXAMPLES then maybe the PRICES, have a think about it, see what you think and if it suits contact me either by email or phone by clicking the relevant buttons at the bottom of any page.

It is always essential to understand the results of your website design. Microsoft Clarity This can also incorporate both the data from Google Analytics and Tag Manager but the thing I find particularly powerful is the use of heatmaps, which show you how your users actually used your website design site and what they clicked on. Embedded app - Visitor Analysis It is possible to add an embedded app to your website design site with body tracking code to analyse many of the things google analytics and clarity do combined with a few more specific areas included , this covers overall visitors, top landing pages (or all if you prefer), countries, towns, operating systems used, devices used, latest visitors, their IP addresses, top referrers, most used Browers, visual maps with pins, etc. etc. and the great thing is you can vary the period you are producing these statistics for, daily, monthly, yearly and / or since the beginning of time for your site. The free version of this app comes with some restrictions, if you wish to use the very powerful add-ons that would come with a price to be added on later, clearly up to you.

Looking for a website designer near me who does great website design? 0 Go To Bottom of Page KHWD Log In KHWD's Website design & development PRICE guide Probably sensible to talk to me about website design so we can discuss it BUT if all you are after is a very quick headline QUOTE to make your mind up then this list below should help. Hope this info helps you think a bit more clearly about website design. Other things to factor in are (in no particular order)! I can automatically populate both a Facebook and Instagram shop for you directly from the products added to your website design at no additional cost (assuming FB security and you allow me to hook to your FB page and you have FB linked to your Instagram page (easy to set up)) This means every time you add a product to your site it ends up in both your FB & Insta shops (generally arrive in about 2 days as controlled by Meta Inc). This is very useful website design propagation. For an additional cost (TBC) you could also auto-populate on eBay if that’s an area you wish to sell on. Sadly, as I know from my wife’s website design experience, I cannot auto populate Etsy, Shopify, Made Me, Amazon Handmade etc. etc. they do have to be done manually. This can be a priced add on to your website design. 2/3rd payment up front before website design and development then the final 1/3rd when you are completely happy. NOTE Only available if you take a domain name I already have otherwise there is a yearly charge paid up front. On website design maintenance I would do that on a one-off basis (unlike most of the big companies who charge a maintenance subscription) so my table of charges is £50 for 2 “website design changes” (clearly if they are substantial that price is negotiable) and £30 for up to 10 product additions in a shop upload if your site is an e-commerce site. SO, take my domain name, no changes, no charges for maintenance, up to you, this could be a very cheap option to you. Domain names / URLs a) new site no issue b) if you are redeveloping / recreating an existing online presence then depending upon who is your domain provider I may be able to transfer across to my site provider for a very small cost or indeed we can ask them to redirect (which they may not do) OR depending on how wedded you are to your current URL we can get a new one for you at approx. £12.50 + VAT / annum (2022 prices), entirely up to you. For e-commerce website design sites, you will need provide me with your T&Cs and Shipping costs, locally and globally although if you would prefer (having already done all the research for my wife’s small biz I can just copy those) also please let me know if you intend your business to be VAT registered or it already is? Once we have discussed the full website design requirement a complete quote for the work will be provided so we both know where we stand I am not VAT registered, the price you see is what you pay for website design / development / maintenance. Domain names / URL do however attract VAT.

It has a lot of searches that use that keyword but it is also something that has a very high number of competitors. Note the big boys (and girls) SEO offerings are just far too expensive in the scheme of things, SEMrush are off the scale. So having selected that I came upon Rabbit SEO Traffic Booster app in the WIX app store and chose to invest in it, one of the best decisions I ever made. Ron who is the key support is just so helpful, I can't recommend this product and service enough and will make it available to all my clients, for a fee obviously. I am getting to understand it's power in a lot greater detail now and the Help texts and manuals are a godsend as well as Ron's availability to answer my forever annoying (I suspect) probing to help increase my understanding. Want to have a look at this 5* SEO Tool in more detail? If you would like to add this service to your website design please visit the SHOP what more can I say, this gets a HUGE tick from KHWD Return to MENU Features of the Product The dashboard is a great visual help as a starting point and the user manual is a must read. Everything on your account is highly configurable and helps you decide what you get and how often. You can even chose the search engine you want to focus in on, I chose Google as its the one most used in the United Kingdom, but you could chose otherwise. It interprets your landing pages and analyses them. It also tells you who your top competitors are and enables you to produce a report of the backlinks and keywords they use which is a great starting point (and set of pointers) for your SEO strategy. #seo Here is a page extract from a report of one of KeefH Web Designs key competitors to give you a flavour of what I mean. As an aside you can capture almost anything you are researching in the tool via PDF, Excel spreadsheet or copying it to the clipboard for insertion into say a word document or whatever you chose, pretty useful facility #hintsandtips example of competitor data, recommended, great help So, lets start firstly with keywords. Depending upon how much you are prepared to spend, as a poor pensioner I chose the \\\"lightest\\\" package price wise, which enables you to track upto 40 keywords,(Ron kindly gave me an extra 5 re feedback etc.) more than the standard 5 WIX's SEMrush allowed, and better still it gives you some suggestions to add. One thing I have learnt during my experimentation is that what you may logically think is a sensible and obvious keyword string for your site is not necessarily in SEO and website design the most obvious, for example on my motorhome-travels blog site the most used and searched keyword is \\\"wagtail country park\\\", it just shows how automated and mathematical the algorithms within the google search engine are, it sees letters and words and makes no attempt to \\\"understand them\\\" #learning What a browser search engine robot such as google uses is a \\\"web crawler\\\" which runs across mostly the text content of you web site and looks for certain criteria it has predetermined make a valued site. One must bear in mind that those rules can and do change over time as the web crawler companies refine their selection processes so your SEO is an ongoing thing, and Rabbit SEO Traffic Booster makes that an easy process to continue evaluating. #recommended You also get 4 basic backlinks added a month assuming you have a yearly subscription. You could of course just do a monthly contract and get all your learning from that, but my view is with SEO you must give it time. Backlinks both internal and external are very important to your overall rank ranking either at the domain level or the landing page level. More analysis on website design SEO keywords. Next we will look at what help there is in detail to improve your SEO on your website design pages, this is the Landing page analysis. Initially you are given a traffic light warning against each and every one of your site pages that are included in browser crawling. You can then use this wonderful data analysis to think about and adjust you SEO entries. If you run through the slides here you will see just how methodical and helpful Rabbit SEO Traffic Booster can be to your improved SEO on your website design. You can even use this to tab through on each set of keywords you would like to target. #learning #design #development Internal and external links are also shown as well as the total page contents that a web browser crawler see. Next we come to Backlink Analysis, as I said before getting good quality backlinks (both internally and externally) to your site are currently in search engine investigations very valuable, it's like this recommendation here for Rabbit SEO and Ron, I think they are great and don't mind saying so, other sites who are high up the pecking order saying the same for your site are a big advantage. I hope that makes sense. Anyhow these are the options available to you and lots of graphs to make investigation and analysis easy. I find it an incredibly good check of the progress of both ones basic and premium backlinks building portfolio. Let's look at the Links summary, explorer and history provided by the app. There are a plethora of graph available, just look across the menu in links history. Namely new links, links issues, types, location on page of link type and associated anchors etc. etc. All amazingly useful and highly recommended. As you get (with this package) 4 links a month , basic links, you can set the slider to allow Rabbit SEO to find and set them up for you or chose to define your own, you select the keyword you want them created for. More on Competitors backlinks , this enables you to look a little more in depth at the established competitors in your field and may well give you some good website design keyword ideas. look in a bit more detail at your competitors So hopefully that gives a bit more of a flavour of this very useful tool SEO-wise, there is a lot more to learn and a lot more depth to it. Ron has also suggested 2 other apps that may be useful in SEO and backlinks but I've not really had a chance to look at them as yet, maybe that is for another day Links4u SEOly Return to MENU The END 2022 blogs featured logos new techniques other seo recommended strategy hashtags hintsandtips KHWD Other 0 views0 commentsPost not marked as liked Go To Top of Page The home of great website design Could be yours, example sites 9-12 Visitors Map Some of My Sites MHT Blog 2007-8 2010 2013 2017 SGDDs\",\"score\":88,\"metaKeywords\":\"website deisgn\",\"pageTitleContainsKeyword\":true,\"metaKeywordsContainsKeyword\":false,\"metaOgSiteUrl\":\"\",\"H1Count\":1,\"metaDesc\":\"Recommended App and Product Rabbit SEO traffic booster, Blog 10 created by KeefH Web Designs, the home of great website design, on 13th December 2022 , a very useful Search engine optimisation tool\",\"failedTests\":1,\"H1\":\"Blog 10 - Recommended, Rabbit SEO Traffic Booster - Website Design Considerations\",\"keywordTerm\":\"website design\",\"linksOut\":17,\"linksIn\":54,\"countWordMatches\":15,\"H2Exists\":2,\"H1Length\":81,\"H1ContainsKeyword\":true,\"pageUrl\":\"https://www.keefh-web-designs.org.uk/post/blog-10-recommended-rabbit-seo-traffic-booster-website-design-considerations/\",\"favIconUrl\":\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ad8375_9c6e29c72ecb4fa782f27e5af540a1c5%7Emv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_32%2Ch_32%2Clg_1%2Cusm_0.66_1.00_0.01/ad8375_9c6e29c72ecb4fa782f27e5af540a1c5%7Emv2.jpg\"}"

You can have the last 100 for free, but up to a 1000 for a moderate fee. I find it graphically a wholly useful tool where if you so choose you can quickly, professionally and conveniently drill down to get the base details. You may want to include this in your website selection #hintsandtips There are 27 map formats you can select if you are paying for the enhanced inclusion but only 4 with limited functionality if you choose the free offering. To illustrate quite how far you can zoom in to get the details on for example my KeefH Web Designs site's enhanced visitor's map click HERE enhanced Visitors map for KeefH Web Designs motorhome-travels blog advanced visitor's map motorhome-travels blog website enhanced visitor's map serendipity girl's designer dresses advanced visitor's map SerendipityGDDs website's enhanced visitor's map Generic free Visitor's map which allows up to 100 last visits or locations. I have used this on all my remaining 8 web sites, 4 of which are currently available for you to claim for yourselves and i will design and enhance to fit your total requirements. example of the standard free visitor's map you could apply to your site as a plug in ZOOMING IN Take a look at this slideshow to see how one can start at the highest level and continue to click on the locations counter to forever delve down into the scaled map until you reach the lowest level to see where your visitor looked at your site from. If you want to take it even further you can hit the plus \\\"+\\\" zoom button in the top left-hand corner to possibly get down to the street level, now that is spooky! It is also possible to use standard google maps to identify a place for example where your business is or some other location you wish to highlight. You can even embed a google map into a website which is scalable fixated initially at the location of your choice. Take a look at these 2 examples. I must confess these standard maps are not as visually appealing as the plug-in app but in a way that is quite understandable but may be sufficient for your site. Here is an example of an embedded google map plus of course my own KeefH Web Designs google maps entry. This is also the same on Bing Maps folks! In techy terms one uses an HTML embed of a website address the other uses an emved of code, but they can both achieve the same end result.

The technical word on the street is now VSEO or Video Search Engine Optimisation. VSEO is simply about optimising your video so that it is indexed and ranks on the search engine results pages for applicable keyword searches. This is another string to your website design bow. There are many optimisation strategies to give your videos a higher chance of ranking. When it all comes down to the issue of, “What is video SEO?” the same fundamental rules are applicable. Videos are a type of content, a popular one at that, and should be treated with exactly the same sort of attention as a blog post or product page within your website design. Although, there’s a catch with VSEO. Bots can’t watch video – they can only view text metadata such as the title and tags. Ordinary website design SEO has an advantage over this. This should mean that they can’t crawl, index as well as rank video content. Right? Well, not quite. While it is true that bots don’t have the ability to watch a video in the traditional sense, the great news is that there’s still a way to get your videos “seen” by search engines. Website design considerations are for ever increasing in complexity if you want to be seen. Return to MENU THE NEW YOU TUBE HANDLE From October 2022 You Tube is introducing a new handle for your Channel, this is being slowly rolled out across all their subscribers and adds to the already available custom URL and user links already available, indeed if you do nothing your new handle will default to the custom URL assuming you have one. You can of course alter it to one of your own choosing, using your brand name is a good bet assuming it doesn't already belong to another channel. My current custom URL which I use to promote my main keyword anchor text website designers near me is HERE. My You Tube username link is HERE And my new You Tube handle link, which is not fully functional across You Tube as yet is HERE Extra You Tube Channels I maintain for my lovely wife Annie's small craft biz are these 2 based around her lovely Girls Designer Clothing from her website design shop and they are i) custom URL Anne Hellinger / handle GirlsDesignerClothing and ii) old-style username SerendipityGDDs / handle GirlsDesignerClothes , I have started re-maintaining these channels and had a non Gmail account against the 2nd so have had to do a lot of work resurrecting it as it was set up in 2010, phew not easy I can tell you, but fully functional now, thank heavens. Onwards and upwards with website design. These are 2 of the 3 approvals I got from You Tube as they roll out their new offer of creating a handle for your channel, which supports your website design. Previously there was a You Tube URL name for your channel and a much older user variety, this brings You Tube into the current. These are screen shots of our 3 You Tube Channels as an example, they are taken off a phone, but configuration is such that they work on phone, tablet, laptop, desktop and TV screen or indeed any device you care to mention that can run You Tube. I'm looking for new subscribers for all 3 Channels, if you do subscribe, I will ALWAYs subscribe to your channel. Return to MENU KHWD's YOU TUBE PLAYLISTS Here is a list of my playlists held on my You Tube channel in ascending order of number of number of videos in that playlist. You can set up whatever Playlists you want to categorise elements of what you are trying to say or sell. Using descriptions against each Playlist further enhances your SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) The first is a no clickable image, the second is a table which if you click on the name will take you directly to that playlist #fun #websitedesignersnearme KHWD Playlists in ascending order to number of videos PLAYLIST NAME / NUMBER OF VIDEOS Click on the link to view, thanks NOTE also that this list is correct at time of going to print on 27 October 2022, clearly the latest actual count of playlists can be seen directly on my KHWD YOU TUBE CHANNEL 1999 7 France 10 Top 10 Videos on this Channel 19/9/22 10 1997 10 Top 10 Videos on this Channel 10/9/21 10 Web Design Ideas (KHWD) 10 1995 14 China & Hong Kong 16 2012 17 2014 23 Malaysia 23 2020 23 2015 23 Audiobooks 24 Pacific Islands 28 Scandinavia 37 2016 41 Xmas 43 SerendipityGDDs 46 Europe 48 Singapore 51 2010 54 Genealogy 57 2019 64 SerendipityGDDs2 78 2022 92 2018 105 Canada and the USA 106 New Zealand 110 2013 112 2021 114 Older Family Stuff 115 2007-8 134 KeefH Web Designs 140 2017 148 Family stuff pre 2012 159 Australia 177 Campsites 206 Favourites (no direct link available) 231 Family stuff post 2012 241 motorhome-travels 442 Music 4 TV (KHWD) 478 Xmas Songs (KHWD) 596 If you would like a copy of the Excel spreadsheet that shows all my You tube playlists by alphabetical order and in descending number of videos with the links to find them then feel free to download that spreadsheet here, its 28.5KB in size so fairly small, i.e., it packs a punch. KeefH Web Designs Playlist count .xlsx Download XLSX • 29KB Return to MENU LEARNING POINTS Tables within a BLOG enable you to have as many rows and columns as you wish, unfortunately even though you can control the width of each column on a slider you cannot adjust the font size which defaults to your site paragraph text height which means in mobile view sometimes it looks a little large, oh well, it is what it is, I spent quite a while sorting that. One great thing though is that you can insert almost anything, image, video, html, SoundCloud item, file, GIF etc. etc. into a column entry in your table. Return to MENU FEATURED YOU TUBE CHANNELS On your You Tube channel entry page you can add a section to show featured other You Tube channels, these are also available on the main menu tab. In KeefH Web Designs You Tube channel I show those 2 channels I have set up for Annie to feature videos associated with the handmade designer little girls' clothes she creates.

You tube can be a great website design marketing enhancer. We will see how it goes, no need to beg in my humble opinion, it's all about ensuring the content hits the spot! Ok maybe I will just beg, website design madness #haha I have realised whilst writing this website design blog that I have learnt a lot about my own You Tube channel and the power of what is possible, so maybe give it a go yourself, it is very rich in functionality, and some of this website design Blog may help to point you in the right direction. I can of course offer this website design You Tube set up and configuration as an add on service. To see my You Tube Channel please click HERE why not subscribe to KeefH Web Designs You Tube Channel, Thanks Feel free to use this menu to go straight to the section that is of interest to you or just carry on and read straight thru the website design techniques Blog, the choice is yours, thanks for looking. MENU Creation Tips About your You Tube Channel Statistics and Analytics available Top 10 Videos My Videos My Playlists Other related Channels may help Your new channel on your website (Promotion/Marketing) That's all folks CREATION TIPS FOR GOOD WEBSITE DESIGN I use Microsoft's Photos app either in automatic mode and let it create all the transitions and add royalty free music if there are a lot of images but if it is a small number of images and you want to add your own soundtrack, for instance an audiobook overlay, which you have published on SoundCloud for example, then I might just use the create video feature and alter the duration of slides, which currently defaults to 3 seconds per slide and / or add transitions , text, header , whatever and add my own custom audio track of music first checking with the Warner's protection rights list as to whether it is possible to use on You Tube as long as it is not for monetarisation. This is a good early check as You Tube's automatic checks are very sophisticated and it could result in your video not being playable in one or all countries, you have been warned, I of course have fallen foul of these many times over the years. Clearly there are many apps, software packages on the market for photo, audio and video editing, you don't have to use what I use. Once you have your standalone video slideshow of images available it is time to use You Tube's website design studio to upload your creation. Add a title (100 characters or less) for SEO purposes the longer the better. Add a description. Add tag key words, identify if this video is for children or not, and publish. Job done, well mostly apart from checking all looks good and then time to embed in your chosen website. Return to MENU ABOUT YOUR CHANNEL You can either have a personal You Tube Channel or a Business One, the business one means you can authorise other to add content should you wish. I personally have used my website design channel to both limit the need to use up valuable data storage on my websites but also as a structured way of finding past videos and enhancing my sites. It's worth thinking about your website design logo and background and associated available links in your channel header carefully as this will enable you to tie into your business brand fully. The following is quite a good overview, if you would like to read it, please click HERE, thanks Set up your about me channel page so that people can see who you are and what you stand for, maybe incorporating your unique selling point (USP), my overriding advice would be to keep it short and get straight to the point. About Your Channel The HOME page on your You Tube channel is where your viewers will arrive if they have clicked on the link to your channel, here you can customise your channel and manage all your videos. Tip branding should be heavily linked to website design. Its also worth thinking about VSEO. KeefH Web Designs You Tube Channel HOME page Note that where viewers arrive at your You Tube channel is quite different from the editor you will be using as the \\\"owner\\\" within the You Tube website design studio tool. This is because in essence the channel is for \\\"published videos whereas the Studio editor is where you are constructing i.e., uploading, processing and checking (for validity) your videos prior to publishing them. I do hope that makes sense; it was a concept in the early days I struggled to get my head around. #tip Always match your you tube design to your website design. You Tube Designer Studio Dashboard Return to MENU STATISTICS / ANALYTICS Currently as at the end of September 2022 KeefH Web Designs (KHWD website designs) has 922 videos, 39 Playlists, 24,379 views and 18 subscribers. I started my You Tube channel back in July 2009 when I was using it mainly for the type of music, I am interested in, but it then morphed into being one of my main vehicles for showing images in a slideshow within websites for 2 main reasons, i) the vehicle I had been using for such functionality called Photosnack went bust ii) one always want to control the data space used within a website for reasons of cost and speed of page load. So far, my You Tube channel has been in operation for 4830 days, with only 18 subscribers over that time I would say it has been very remiss of me not to have promoted it more, I am attempting to address that now with this Blog, let's see how it goes. Statistically that also means we have added a new video about once every 5 days, now that shows my dedication to the cause and if you have the content that could be useful to you for your business as well #justsaying Using You Tube Studio which is a very useful tool you can glean a lot about how your channel is performing and tweak it accordingly, allegedly marketing helps, but what do I know #haha Analysis of Channel for last month Clearly you can adjust the timeframe you are looking at (see image below for ideas / options) plus make comparisons between time frames if you so choose and review content, split between videos and shorts, indeed you can now achieve live reels if your confidence allows (currently mine doesn't) audiences showing numbers of unique viewers, additional subscribers within the period you are monitoring and returning visitors. I guess the aim must be to steadily increase your number of returning visitors to build brand loyalty. You can even examine which of your videos are rowing your audience. Some of the analytic tools are very powerful to the nth degree, if you click on \\\"See More\\\" you can delve down another level and see things like geography, gender, age group, which traffic source was used, whether viewers are subscribers or not and percentages shown for each, now is the challenge of how to convert a casual viewer to a subscriber, answers on a postcard please plus a whole lot of other options most of which I don't have a clue about yet, but rest assured I will #nerd The final thing you can look at is research, you can even see what you viewers have been searching for, all of which may be useful to you and your brand. Basically, the power of the \\\"investigate\\\" is available to you to help make the right decisions for you, maybe give it a go as and when you have a channel, KeefH Web Designs can help with that. Return to MENU TOP 10 This leads nicely on from Statistics and Analysis. Here is my latest Top 10 Playlist. I review and recreate yearly but if it interests you, you could do more or less frequently and / or adjust the number of videos to feature in your Top of the Pops. The combined total views of my top 10 videos are 8919 (as at 30 Sept. 2022). Thats almost 37% of all the views my channel has received, would be very interesting to understand what makes those particular videos so popular, is featuring them in a Top 10 a self-fulfilling exercise I wonder. The other observation I would make is that all entries in my current Top 10 are short in length i.e., they are all under 12 minutes with half under 5 minutes and the other half under 12 minutes in duration. Return to MENU VIDEOS If viewers click on the VIDEOS tab when they arrive at your You Tube channel, they will be presented with ALL of your channel's videos. It is possible to both search for individual named videos and use any criterion for searching as well as using the predefined sort options of most popular, oldest or newest, the choice is yours. Search, Sort or Scroll thru the Channel Video offerings Return to MENU PLAYLISTS Here is a summary of all our playlists, note some are external to the websites under KeefH Web Designs remit but that is what I mean about hooking in other channels. Currently 39 of these playlists which are the mechanism for delivering slideshows and slideshows with Audiobook overlays are listed here, indeed that KeefH Web Designs playlist is the one that features on this website. See this on our EXAMPLES page. On the HOME page of your channel when you are considering a format you would like to show, consider also showing featured playlists, in my example here I have chosen to feature motorhome videos and campsites, but you could choose any of your playlists and also as many as you like but take care not to show them all, that is what the playlist tab is all about. an example of configured playlists when customising your channel Return to MENU HOOKING IN OTHER CHANNELS You may find there are other You Tube channels out there in the ether that relate and support / promote what you are trying to achieve, the design studio gives you the option to include those. I personally haven't as yet done that but if you think it is of value you can set it up in your channel customisation. Return to MENU EMBEDDING YOUR CHANNEL ON YOUR WEBSITES I would suggest putting this in the header of your website if you are using it as a real promoter of your site and /or brand rather like using other forms of social media to market yourself. There are two levels to this, one at the channel level and the other where I have used the individual videos to insert on my sites to save data space and speed of site load, both very important. Here is an example taken from my motorhome travels blog website.

It works for desktop, laptop, mobile and tablet. It remains fixed in position at the base of any scrollable website design page. To launch just click on the bubble chat button and type your message. All chat website design and developments are highly configurable in colours, backgrounds, fonts etc. etc. so can be made to match your site concept and layout. The great advantage of the KHWD chat box is the ability to instantaneously give your audience the potential to contact you immediately and in my humble opinion more importantly instant information about a website design visitor by just having the WIX spaces app on your mobile, whether from the Apple store or Google play store dependent on you using iOS or Android as your mobile operating system.

If you have taken a website from us and are not keen on doing your own marketing for it, whether that is an e-commerce shop site, blog or just standard website and you really don't want the hassle of having to do all that targeting whether via social media, emails or whatever communications methodology you want we here at KeefH Web Designs can take a weight off your shoulders and do all that for you. I've been using Microsoft's new multi-track video advert creator, especially some of the Marketing templates which now I understand it are reasonable easy to manipulate to achieve what one wants. It has limited functionality as a free package (which I am currently experimenting with). My charge is for both my services and time and a contribution towards the upgrade of the software package to afford heaps more functionality, resolution quality and access to high quality stock images, videos and audio. A truly professional end product. Anyhow I show here some of my examples which might fit what you want, clearly these are mt examples, yours would be fully fashioned.

What is it they say, you are never to old to learn and my guess is this will be a journey of discovery over the coming weeks and months and hopefully to my customers advantage. We will see, I am certainly enjoying the learning... little grey cells etc. etc. This website design blog no 4 talks about 2D animation using Lottie Files and Converters to create my own or embed from the Catalogue. Hugely fun and useful website design add on techniques. a voyage of discovery, the world of 2D animations If you would like to see what I have achieved already by \\\"borrowing\\\" some existing 2D animations from LottieFiles look here under the Mickey, Fireworks and Pula tabs on my HOLIDAY2010 site, it will give you some ideas. I've joking referred to these examples as my \\\"Mickey & Lottie Animations Studio Inc.\\\" One either inserts these into your website design as embedded HTML, straight java .json files or the rather antiquated iframes which I initially had to use whilst sorting out its use with WIX, an issue for website design but now sorted. Now we can use the Lottie Animation URL direct in the plugin it means the 2D animation becomes both integrated automatically with the theme background colours of your site and is totally scalable, since it is a vector image. Here is a summary of some of the debate I had with WIX to get it all sorted, great fun, NOT! #fun making Lottie files work in WIX In the LottieFiles editor you can upload either SVG (scalable vector graphics) or JSON files. I have tried both. I have yet to use my version of Adobe Illustrator but I will. There are various free converters out there for use with 2D animation manipulation , Convertio is one I have used effectively, it is an online upload / download tool but I also own a whole set of AVS tools at my disposal for conversions etc. etc. The most effective use I have currently though I would say wouldn't I as its my current \\\"best\\\" process was creating an animation video via either AVS video studio or MS's Photo app and then using Isotropic to convert it to the specific Lottie JSON format and then loading it up to LottieFiles. Currently none of my animations sitting on my dashboard will LottieFiles let me publicly publish but I have an open issue request with them to resolve this, once done I will be home and dry and able to offer this as another service. My LottieFiles profile is here if you are at all interested, if its all too techy don't worry, i will take care of all of that for you #nerd #KHWD Sadly it won't (yet) let me show you my dashboard of animations under construction and waiting to be published #boo In order to increase my knowledge and visibility in the web design space and learn from others I have also registered my 1st projects with Dribble, BeHance and GitHub, I have linked them all to my LottieFiles account, you can get to then via the SOCIAL button on the home page in the icon row.

Anyhow in website design and development terms I learnt a few new skills along the way. The extended use of section links via internal MENUs in blogs rather replicates the old website design skill that was easily available under the old Moonfruit editor using what they called sections. With very long blogs whilst in mobile mode (and to a lesser extent desktop mode) it is easy to return to top of page , it is useful to have a return to menu after each distinct section, else a lot of scrolling is necessary. I used every type of gallery format, and the new SoundCloud insertion is a real benefit over iframes which are in coding terms hugely antiquated. I also put some pressure on Yell wrt roles and permissions to enable access to custom code, essential for employing MS's new Clarity which has huge heatmapping advantages over Google Analytics. Tis means you can test at the click level, very useful mostly for e-commerce processing but not to be excluded for all over website processing. Also ensuring that links to my other sites are not penalised in SEO terms by having Google ignore them is a useful tool to prevent Google's automation thinking it is trying to spam the search engines. Another little technique on Blogs is to use the setting advanced option to highlight 3 related blogs which appear at the end of the blog. In the case of this holiday I reviewed all the blogs that had anything to do with the USA and linked them so when you finish that blog you can seamlessly progress to the next \\\"States\\\" related blog, this technique would apply to whatever your particular focus is and the direction you wish to take your visitors / customers. #KeefHWebDesigns #KHWD I've also been using the \\\"local app\\\" NEXTDOOR to promote an autumn offer, i.e. 20% off every service in the SHOP for a month #offer OK thats all for now folks! 2022 design blogs development hashtags introduction new techniques KHWD Development • KHWD Design 0 views0 commentsPost not marked as liked Go To Top of Page The home of great website design Could be yours, example sites 9-12 Visitors Map Some of My Sites MHT Blog 2007-8 2010 2013 2017 SGDDs\",\"score\":88,\"metaKeywords\":\"website design\",\"pageTitleContainsKeyword\":true,\"metaKeywordsContainsKeyword\":true,\"metaOgSiteUrl\":\"\",\"H1Count\":1,\"metaDesc\":\"New website design techniques learnt , this is Blog 3 created by KHWD, the home of great website design, on 25th August 2022 .

Note back in the days of JSP it was well before the concept of a web site and website design was invented. However, in my humble opinion not everything can be automated, and it is the creative skills and ability to spot visually attractive website design opportunity that KeefH Web Designs (currently i.e., me) will add to the website design and development process that my experience and know how bring to the party for you. My examples here on the site will hopefully illustrate some of the website design opportunities for you as you make up your mind. My USP (unique selling point) is \\\" The HOME of Great Website Design, cutting edge professional high-quality website design at affordable prices with a lasting impact. For all your Small Businesses, you can buy a Service \\\" Return to MENU CERTIFICATIONS FOR WEBSITE DESIGN Here are some of the Certifications I have already received #proud #trumpetblowing #whynot KHWD Main Certification by WIX for website design Return to MENU GALLERIES FOR WEBSITE DESIGN There are all manner of types of image gallery that are possible from \\\"grid to slider\\\", and here are each of those in turn featuring Service offerings on the KeefH Web Designs website designs site elsewhere just to show what is possible. It at least shows you what you can chose that best fits what you need to \\\"show off\\\". So we have in menu form Grid Masonry Collage Thumbnails Slideshow Panorama Columns Slider Grid Masonry Collage Thumbnails Slideshow Panorama Columns Slider Return to MENU VIDEOS FOR WEBSITE DESIGN Here is an example of the website design videos you can add either loading up your own but that uses a lot of data space or embedding from one of the many outlets for video, i.e. you tube, vimeo etc. etc. . Return to MENU AUDIOBOOKS You can have them as SoundCloud entries , just the spoken word or attached to your favourite slideshows and videos as a voice over, here are some examples to enhance your website design Use the counter in the top left hand side to see how many videos there are in your playlist and if you so wish expand to see all of them and them chose one that takes your fancy #youtube #enjoy Return to MENU SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS Using social media to promote and advertise your products, services and web site offering is a great way to communicate with others. I can provide any of those based upon whatever social media outlets you use or belong to. There are apps to embed the feeds from the 3 social medias listed here and may well be more in the future. To look at my examples and se if any or all work for you go to the HOME page and use the side bar to scroll to them Social Media Feeds: KHWD home page side bar Return to MENU YOU TUBE Playlists, Videos with an audio book overlay , basically whatever you want or indeed use ones you already have, up to you, it can be done, here is an example of one of KeefH Web Designs playlist to demonstrate what you can do on a website with You Tube videos Use the counter in the top left hand side to see how many videos there are in your playlist and if you so wish expand to see all of them and them chose one that takes your fancy #youtube #enjoy Return to MENU FILES & GIFs You can have both on your site, here are some examples but the possibilities are endless Then one thing you do have to be careful of is its size with respect to FILES as whatever you wish to allow download of on your size first has to be loaded to your site and will use up available data space, so my suggestion would be keep it small loyalty pdf .pdf Download PDF • 779KB Return to MENU IMAGE MANIPULATION I achieve this via a variety of methods, but can certainly achieve most of the things you could ever want to do with any images you supply, from black and white, portrait edge fading, colour enhancement, background replacement, frames, text addition etc. etc. just ask, if I've not seen it before I'm sure with the vast number of tools at my disposal I will be able to satisfy your request and if not I will find a tool that will help. Here are a couple of examples of stuff I have done Return to MENU CONTENT MANAGEMENT AND REPEATER DATA LINKED It is possible to set up almost any content database with numbers, text, images, links, Boolean yes / no buttons etc. etc. although there are in fairness a limited set of data attribute types available (currently) but its still pretty extensive for most uses. Here is my example contents database example content data based on my websites developed You can then link that database to a designed repeater entry to populate the fields you have included there which means in future you can just change the data which will dynamically adjust the page(es) that include the populated repeater See my repeater example here, suggest clicking on the image to see the latest version of this repeater for ALL my websites. See also Dynamic Pages which used in conjunction with Velo code , or not as the case might be will enable you to achieve your specific aims if you need something out of the ordinary and allow you to maintain the data. repeater example linked to content database Locating the Content and Dynamic pages examples Here is a list of the available field types I can use for you within a contents database, i have not tried them all but have used quite a few in the examples here on the website, but have no worries that all are usable within a repeater set of dynamic pages and can be further refined with Velo code if need be #cookingongas #suckingupdiesel list of available field type i can use for you in a contents database There are some limitations in the field types, e.g., under video it is not possible to dynamically link to a transparent video. These are the sort that can run over the top of your page background and cleverly show what you want. These have to be applied using VideoBox. See Dynamic page example here and use the side index to find \\\"transparent\\\" Return to MENU VELO This is WIX's additional JavaScript development tool to add onto your website and do the stuff that you just can't do any other way, it can result in some deeply techy stuff so if you don't have to do it the simple message is don't, I have found through learning that sometimes it is incredibly difficult to analyse and debug an issue if it is not self-evident. Although there is a whole forum of other Velo developers out there at your fingertips often if they haven't done this thing you are trying to do, then it won't help. Still to #simples preferably Here's an example of something I did in the very early days but I'm still learning, I'm sure it is quite a powerful tool to have in your armory. See also Contents Management and Dynamic Pages which are in my humble opinion intrinsically linked Velo practice Return to MENU EDITOR X The bees-knees of responsive website design taking your site to the next level but it comes at a price. I have only just scratched the surface of this development tool but it does seem mighty powerful. More information is available on the web if you are interested, just google it. So my offering which is an add-on is written up in more detail here. Click Me Return to MENU SHOPS This is pretty straight forward stuff, I have 2 examples you may wish to look at, haven't quite yet worked out how to have a mobile API interface to allow folk to add and maintain their own products but I will #challenge SerendipityGDDs Shop KeefH Web Designs Shop Return to MENU BLOGS Likewise this is pretty straight forward stuff, I have 2 examples you may wish to look at. Indeed this blog is part of that example. motorhome-travels blog KeefH Web Designs Blog Return to MENU TRACKING DATA It is always useful to see how your customers are looking at your site, a form of feedback for you and which pages they are looking at and from where, for how long, and how often. There are a variety of things that enable this, not least the Visitor map but Google , WIX and Microsoft Analytics tools. The newest of which is Clarity which enables you to capture and review the keys a visitor has pressed on your site via something called a Heatmap. I can definitely aid you in this on your website as have masses of experience in this sort of analysis over the year. If you want to see more use the button and the side bar for \\\"Analysis\\\", thanks for looking Click HERE You may also want to have a look at the shop item on this, I can definitely help take the technical confusion away for you CLARITY Return to MENU DYNAMIC PAGES This is pretty powerful and enables you to link both a \\\"repeater\\\" designed template to say an item list but there are many template examples that can be used which enables one to fashion web pages that are different from the generic SHOP and BLOG pages, indeed with Velo you can tailor them even further but what you can do without dropping into the depths of coding is pretty useful in itself. Here is one of my examples , see also Contents Management and Velo Note the second example is at the item level and results from clicking the \\\"read more button\\\" it is also fully dynamic, maybe take a look Dynamic Pages Example Dynamic pages example at the lower Item Level Locating the examples of Contents databases and dynamic pages which are intrinsically linked Return to MENU LIGHTBOX There are various predefined option for your use but each of those is also easily configurable to your own desire... i.e backgrounds to colour / image or video, central images can be tailored and linked to another page, action boxes can be altered BUT the standard offerings are around Welcome / Subscriptions / Promotions, clearly if you want something else I'm sure I can work out how to do it quite quickly, it doesn't feel very complex #lightbox Here is my example which is hooked to the award logo on the home page Return to MENU MULTI LINGUAL Now added in principle to this site and allows folk in other countries who speak a different language (In principle) to view your (nad my) site(s) in their own language, note I suspect some words will not translate correctly rather like Google translate I still need test this with a VPN tool to pretend I am elsewhere to see if it really works before offering it as an option #challenge #comingsoon #totest Return to MENU HASHTAGS These can be used liberally throughout your Blogs, not sure about the rest of the site as yet, to act rather like another form of category, certainly for Blogs it will show you all Blogs with that hashtag included, quite a useful way of grouping at least Blogs together, need test other mechanisms like open site text and shop entries. Will let you know once I know #totest Also note that at the end of each blog you have the tags Return to MENU BLOG WRITERS & FEATURED BLOGS You can set up as many different Blog Writers as you wish, and then when you come to publish your Blog under General settings change the writer to whoever from your list you would like to. If you want a blog to appear in your featured Blogs which you can embed and show anywhere on your site then slide across the slider, it defaults when you create a blog to not be set. change writer and/or set as a featured blog Return to MENU TABLES There are 2 types of tables you can have, one in \\\"open\\\" website pages with multi functionality, the other within a blog which has a specific structure and set of limitations which are particular to the Blog functionality. Tables within a BLOG enable you to have as many rows and columns as you wish, unfortunately even though you can control the width of each column on a slider you cannot adjust the font size which defaults to your site paragraph text height which means in mobile view sometimes it looks a little large, oh well, it is what it is, I spent quite a while sorting that. One great thing though is that you can insert almost anything, image, video, html, SoundCloud item, file, GIF etc. etc. into a column entry in your table. Here is an example of what you can do on non-Blog pages within your site Here is an example of what you can do within a blog post table as well as inserting text and all the obvious functionality that comes with a text field.

These travel blog route videos were created using the phone app Travel Boast where I drew out all the places we stopped at on route in order down to in many cases the smallest villages. It then draws out the route with a motorhome (and / or any other animated transportation icon i.e. plane, car, bus, van etc. etc.) driving / flying / travelling to show where we went. I have then hooked its 5 formats I had created into one You Tube video. Landscape, Portrait and square maps which are further altered to be on a map of 5 possible formats i.e.. Day, Night, soft blue, soft grey and one with enhanced road definition just for added effect. It is easy in the phone app to alter these map backgrounds and the orientation of the screen. You can also express the distances travelled in either kilometers or miles. For the purposes of this website and because I work in UK old money all my travel blog routes will be in miles. I have also (where necessary and desired) joined them together with some relevant images and textual overlays using Microsoft's Clipchamp. See what you think, i think it brings the journey to life and adds to any travel blog #newfeature The thing I do find out of kilter though is its estimated distance when compared to the actual distance we have recorded via other means, for example via our motorhome's speedometer which we know are accurate, even more surprising is the fact that between portrait and landscape using the same map data it comes up with different distances travels #wellweird Return to Menu TRAVEL BLOG ROUTES Here are some examples from KeefH Web Designs created motorhome travels blogs site to illustrate the website design technique using an animated map with a variety of transportation vehicle animations attached, they can be in either landscape and / or portrait depending upon which device and audience you are hoping to target with your marketing. Portrait for phones Landscape for tablets and desktops / laptops If you would like to see a full set on the motorhome travel blog for examples of website design techniques click HERE, if you would like to see the You Tube playlist of Travel Blog routes click HERE, thanks for looking. Return to Menu YOU TUBE SHORTS You tube shorts are videos that are less than 60 seconds so you need to get your main message right up front in the video. I find they are a great way to market your website as they are so short you get quite a large audience very quickly. They are identified in a different section in your You Tube channel and should be headed with #short Here is an example, see what you think? Look at our YOU TUBE shorts HERE Try the \\\"popular view\\\" this will give you all my you tube shorts in descending order of views. A useful sort filter, see what you think. Return to Menu FACEBOOK & INSTAGRAM MARKETING Instagram Reels came first but now you can do the same with Facebook. They are similar in nature to the You Tbe shorts in that they are only 60 seconds long mostly and in portrait mode orientation. Apparently TikTok is the same although I haven't got that far as yet but I'm sure they are all the same, quick short ways of getting across your message either via marketing or entertainment, the duration is the key, nearly everyone can cope with that so its a great way to get your message across. My examples can be found firstly on my Instagram feed here on the site, click HERE and scroll down to Insta feeds either via the drop down or side bar, secondly on my Facebook feed can be accessed in exactly the same way. Stories are slightly different in that they are static image if delivered from desktop / laptop with words around them and they stay on your page, not yet sure if you can use video in a story if created on a phone, I will try it out! I posted this as a Facebook & Instagram reel Return to Menu THE END Bye from travel routes, this GIF is so familiar to our end of journey first stop #haha Return to Menu 2023 blogs design development hashtags hintsandtips introduction marketing new techniques you tube travel blog routes KHWD Other 0 views0 commentsPost not marked as liked Trailer Go To Top of Page Privacy Policy The home of great website design Could be yours, example sites 9-12 Visitors Map Some of My Sites MHT Blog 2007-8 2010 2013 2017 SGDDs bottom of page\",\"score\":88,\"metaKeywords\":\"website design\",\"pageTitleContainsKeyword\":true,\"metaKeywordsContainsKeyword\":true,\"metaOgSiteUrl\":\"https://www.keefh-web-designs.org.uk/post/blog-11-new-techniques-using-travel-boast-and-clipchamp-for-you-tube-shorts-fb-insta-reels-story\",\"H1Count\":1,\"metaDesc\":\"New Techniques employed by KHWD to help market your travel blogs or other valid creations, created by KeefH Web Designs, the home of great website design, on Burns night, 25th January 2023 at 16.33 p.m. MENU Overview Travel Blog Routes You Tube Shorts Facebook and Instagram Reels & Stories via Meta Thats all folks\",\"failedTests\":1,\"H1\":\"Blog 11 Website Design for Video shorts & Reels\",\"keywordTerm\":\"website design\",\"linksOut\":23,\"linksIn\":55,\"countWordMatches\":11,\"H2Exists\":2,\"H1Length\":47,\"H1ContainsKeyword\":true,\"pageUrl\":\"https://www.keefh-web-designs.org.uk/post/blog-11-new-techniques-using-travel-boast-and-clipchamp-for-you-tube-shorts-fb-insta-reels-story/\",\"favIconUrl\":\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ad8375_9c6e29c72ecb4fa782f27e5af540a1c5%7Emv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_32%2Ch_32%2Clg_1%2Cusm_0.66_1.00_0.01/ad8375_9c6e29c72ecb4fa782f27e5af540a1c5%7Emv2.jpg\"}"

This could be a very useful tool and time will tell quite how much value it can add to your website design and development. The jury is currently out EXAMPLES Here is the Podcast playlist on my latest channel, mostly for Serendipity Girls Designer Dresses development SOUNDCLOUD & YOU TUBE PODCASTS Where sensible I will convert Soundcloud tracks to Podcasts by adding an appropriate video element. You tube will not accept striaght audio podcasts (as yet) sadly This podcast is my original SerendipityGDDs \\\"track\\\" or audiobook posted on Soundcloud and having product specific video / content overlayed onto it to create a You Tube acceptable podcast, they must have video attached. Let's see! ISSUES (TBC) Currently I have been in a long battle with You Tube to determine why this fuunctionailty is not available on my first, and major You Tube channel @KeefHWebDesigns but is available on my latest channel @GirlsDesignerClothes all very puzzling. I will update this blog as the case 1-8913000033419 develops.
